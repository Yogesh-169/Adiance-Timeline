# Video Timeline Player Features

Based on the analysis of the hls.js demo timeline, here are the key features that need to be implemented:

## Timeline Visualization
- Canvas-based timeline rendering for performance
- Multiple buffer level visualization (media buffer, video buffer, audio buffer)
- Resolution/quality level indicators
- Time markers with proper scaling (0, 1:40, 3:20, 5:00, etc.)
- Visual indication of loaded segments
- Current playback position indicator

## Interactive Controls
- Zoom functionality to show more detailed time segments
- Second-level granularity when zoomed in
- Click-to-seek on timeline
- Drag functionality for seeking
- Synchronization with video playback (timeline updates as video plays)

## Format Support
- Support for multiple video formats (MP4, HLS, VLS, etc.)
- Adaptable to different video sources and qualities
- Buffer visualization for different quality levels

## UI Components
- Timeline container with proper scaling
- Zoom controls
- Time markers that adjust based on zoom level
- Playback controls integrated with timeline
- Buffer level indicators for different resolutions

## Technical Requirements
- React-based implementation
- Canvas for rendering timeline elements
- Event listeners for user interactions
- Synchronization with video element
- Support for different video formats through appropriate libraries
